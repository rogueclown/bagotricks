as the title implies, this repository is a mixed bag of python scripts,
generally focused at automating common repetitive pen testing tasks.

notes about dependencies or requirements for individual scripts:

* headerchecker.py: requires curl.
* peepcompile.py: no outside programs or nonstandard modules required.
